You're going to make a game just like the one in the video. Essentially, the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. Put the following text on your page


* hit any letter to start off the game
* you are given 10 guesses to guess the correct letter
* if you guess the correct letter within 10 guesses you win, if you don't you lose
* game will reset if you win or lose
